# Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

## Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX and APIs

### Synchronous code

-   Most code is synchronous
-   Synchronous code is executed line by line
-   Each line of code waits for previous line to finish
-   Long-running opertaions block code execution

### Asynchronous code

-   Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the “background” finishes
-   Asynchronous code is non-blocking
-   Execution doesn’t wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work
-   Callback funtions alone do NOT make code asynchronous
    Also addEventListener does NOT automatically make code asynchronous

⇒ Asynchronous coordinating behavior of a program over a period of time

### AJAX

AJAX : Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

: Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.

### API

: Application Programming Interface

: Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other.

-   “Online” API : Application running on a server, that receives requests for data, and sends data back as response
-   We can build our own web APIs (requires back-end development, e.g. node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs
