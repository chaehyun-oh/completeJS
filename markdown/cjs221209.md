# Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional

## Declarative and Functional JavaScript Principles

: Two fundamentally different ways of writing code (paradigms)

### Imperative

-   Programmer explains “How to do things”
-   We explain the computer every single step it has to follow to achieve a result

### Declarative

-   Programmer tells “WHAT to do”
-   We simply describe the way the computer should achieve the result
-   the HOW (step-by-step instructions) gets abstracted away

### Functional Programming

-   Declarative programming paradigm
-   Based on the idea of writing software by combining many pure functions, avoiding side effects and mutating data
    -   side effect : Modification(mutation) of any data outside of the function (mutating external variables, logging to console, writing to DOM, etc)
    -   pure function : Function without side effects. Does not depend on external variables. Given the same inputs, always returns the same outputs.
    -   Immutability : State (data) is never modified! Instead, state is copied and the copy is mutated and returned.

Functional programming techniques

-   Try to avoid data mutations
-   Use built-in methods that don’t produce side effects
-   Do data transformations with methods such as `.map(), filter(), reduce()`
-   Try to avoid side effects in functions: this is of course not always possible

Declarative syntax

-   Use array and object destructuring
-   Use the spread operator
-   Use the ternary (conditional) operator
-   User template literals
