# Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional

## Declarative and Functional JavaScript Principles

: Two fundamentally different ways of writing code (paradigms)

### Imperative

-   Programmer explains “How to do things”
-   We explain the computer every single step it has to follow to achieve a result

### Declarative

-   Programmer tells “WHAT to do”
-   We simply describe the way the computer should achieve the result
-   the HOW (step-by-step instructions) gets abstracted away
