# Working with Arrays

## some and every

: So if there is any value for which condition is true, then the some method will retrurn true.

The every method is pretty similar to the some method but as you might guess, the difference between them is that every method only returns true if all of the elements in the array satisfy the condition that we pass in. So in other words, if every element passes the test in our callback function, only then the every method returns true and that’s why the method is called every in the first place.

```jsx
const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];

//  Equality
console.log(movements.includes(-130));

// Condition
console.log(movements.some((mov) => mov === -130));

const anyDeposit = movements.some((mov) => mov > 0);
console.log(anyDeposit);

// Every method
console.log(movements.every((mov) => mov > 0));
console.log(account4.movements.every((mov) => mov > 0));

//  separate callback
const deposit = (mov) => mov > 0;
console.log(movements.some(deposit));
console.log(movements.every(deposit));
console.log(movements.filter(deposit));
```

## flat and flatMap

: flat and flatMap method were introduced in ES2019. So they will therefore not work in super old browser.

So flat method removed the nested arrays and flattened the array. which is why the method is called flat. and the flat method only goes one level deep, when flattening the array. So we can fortunately fix that, by using the depth argument.

flatMap also does mapping, it needs to receive exactly the same callback as a map method. Now just notice that, flatMap here only goes one level deep and we cannot change it. So if you do need to go deeper than just one level, you still need to use the flat method.

```jsx
const arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 7, 8];
console.log(arr.flat());

const arrDepp = [[[1, 2], 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7, 8];
console.log(arrDepp.flat(2));

const overallBalance = accounts
	.map((acc) => acc.movements)
	.flat()
	.reduce((acc, mov) => acc + mov, 0);
console.log(overallBalance);

//  flatMap
const overallBalance2 = accounts
	.flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
	.reduce((acc, mov) => acc + mov, 0);
console.log(overallBalance);
```

## Sorting Arrays

: Sorting is a much-discussed topic in computer science and there are conutless algorithms and methods of sorting values.

For now though, we’re simply gonna use JavaScript’s buillt-in sort method.

sort method actually mutates the original array. and sort method does the sorting based on strings. So basically, what it does is to convert everything to strings and then it does the sorting itself.

and in fact, we can fix this by passing in a compare callback function into the sort method.

> we simply take a copy of the array and sort that. And so that’s what we use now slice for and this is one of these situations where we need to actually create a copy, using the slice method and not the spread operator because here we are in the middle of chain.
> _`const_ movs = sort ? movements.slice().sort((_a_, _b_) => a - b) : movements;`

```jsx
const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];

const owners = ["Jonas", "Zach", "Adam", "Martha"];
console.log(owners.sort());

console.log(movements);
// ascending
// movements.sort((a, b) => {
//   if (a > b)
//     return 1;
//   if (a < b)
//     return -1;
// });
movements.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(movements);

// descending
// movements.sort((a, b) => {
//   if (a > b)
//     return -1;
//   if (a < b)
//     return 1;
// });
movements.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(movements);
```
