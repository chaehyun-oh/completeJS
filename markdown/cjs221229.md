# Forkify App: Building a Modern Application

## Wrapping Up: Final Considerations

JSDoc

[Index](https://jsdoc.app/)

```jsx
/**
 * Render the received object to the DOM
 * @param {Object | Object[]} data The data to be rendered (e.g. recipe)
 * @param {boolean} [render=true] If false, create markup string instead of rendering to the DOM
 * @returns {undefined | string} A markup string is returned if render=false
 * @this {Object} View instance

```

### Improvement and feature ideas

-   Display number of pages between the pagination buttons
-   Ability to sort search results by duration or number of ingredients
-   Perform ingredient validation in view, before submitting the form
-   Improve recipe ingredient input: separate in multiple fields and allow more than 6 ingredients
-   Shopping list feature: button on recipe to add ingredients to a list
-   Weekly meal planning feature: assign recipes to the next 7 days and show on a weekly calendar
-   Get nutrition data on each ingredient from spoonacular API (https://spoonaculer.com/food-api) and calculate total calories of recipe
