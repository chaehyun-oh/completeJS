# Forkify App: Building a Modern Application

## The MVC Architecture

### Why worry about architecture?

-   Structure : Like a house, software needs a structure-the way we organize our code.
-   Maintainability : A project is never done! We need to be able to easily change it in the future.
-   Expandability : We also need to be able to easily add new features.

We can create our won architecture And we can use a well-established architecture pattern like MVC, MVP, Flux, etc …

### Components of any architecture

-   Business logic
    -   Code that solves the actual business problem
    -   Directly related to what business does and what is needs
    -   e.g.) sending messages, storing transactions
-   State
    -   Essentially stores all the data about the application
    -   Should be the “single source of truth”
    -   UI should be kept in sync with the state
    -   State libraries exist
-   HTTP Library
    -   Responsible for making and receiving AJAX requests
    -   Optional but almost always necessary in real-world apps
-   Application Logic (Router)
    -   Code that is only concerned about the implementation of application itself
    -   Handles navigation and UI events
-   Presentation Logic (UI Layer)
    -   Code that is concernd about the visible part of the application
    -   Essentially displays application state

### The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architechture

-   Model - Business logic, state, HTTP library <= Web
-   Controller - Application logic : Bridge between model and views (which don’t know about one another)
-   View - Presentation logic ⇒ User
