# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## Chaining Methods

```jsx
class Account {
	// Public fields (instances)
	locale = navigator.language;

	// Private fields (instances)
	#movements = [];
	#pin;

	// 3) Public methods
	constructor(owner, currency, pin) {
		this.owner = owner;
		this.currency = currency;
		// protected property
		this.#pin = pin;
		// this._movements = [];
		// this.locale = navigator.language;

		console.log(`Thanks for opening an account, ${owner}!`);
	}
	// Public interface
	getMovements() {
		return this.#movements;
	}

	deposit(val) {
		this.#movements.push(val);
		return this;
	}

	withdraw(val) {
		this.deposit(-val);
		return this;
	}

	requestLoan(val) {
		if (this._approveLoan(val)) {
			this.deposit(val);
			console.log(`Loan approved`);
		}
		return this;
	}

	static helper() {
		console.log("Helper");
	}

	// 4) Private methods
	_approveLoan(val) {
		return true;
	}
}

// Chaining
acc1.deposit(300).deposit(500).withdraw(35).requestLoan(25000).withdraw(4000);
console.log(acc1.getMovements());
```

## ES6 Classes Summary

-   Public field : similar to property. available on created object.
-   Private fields : not accessible outside of class
-   Static public fields : available only on class
-   Call to parent (super) class (necessary with extend) Needs to happen before accessing `this`
-   Instance property : available on created object
-   Redefining private field
-   Public method
-   Referencing private field and method
-   Private method (Might not yet work in your browser. “Fake” alternative: \_ instead of # )
-   Getter method
-   Setter method : user \_ to property with same name as method, and also add getter
-   Static method : available only on class. Can not access instance properties nor methods, only static ones
-   Creating new object with new operator

-   Classes are just “syntactic sugar” over constructor functions
-   Classes are not hoisted
-   Classes are first-class citizens
-   Classes body is always executed in strict mode
