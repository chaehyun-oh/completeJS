# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Linking a JS file

-   inline script
    : we don’t have to load anorher file. But on the other hand, it’s pretty bad for separating the website content from the JavaScript logic.
-   external JS file
    : a better separation of concerns between presentation ans logic. And this also makes it easier to maintain code in the long run.

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

## Values and Variables

-   Value
    : a piece of data. It’s most fundamental unit of information that we have in programming.
    one extremely useful thing that we can do with values is to store them into variables. And so this way we can reuse them over and over again.
    variable name will basically replace it with the original value that we assigned to the variable.

Rules for naming variables

-   camelCase : whenever I have multiple words in a variable name, I write the first word with a lower case and then all the next words with upper case.
-   with under score : like fist_name
-   only contain numbers, letters, underscore or the dollar sign.
-   do not use a reserved Javascript keyword
-   when you name your variables it should be really easy to understand exactly what value the variable is holding just by reading the name of the variable.
