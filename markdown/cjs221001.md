# Working with Arrays

## The Magic of Chaining Methods

: So first we should not overuse chaining, so we should try to optimize it because chaining tons of methods one after the other can cause a real performance issues if we have really huge arrays. So if we have huge chain of methods, chained one after the other, we should try to compress all the functionality that they do into as little methods as possible.

And second, it is a bad practice in JavaScript to chain methods that mutate the underlying original array. And an example of that is the splice method. So again, you should not chain a method like the splice or the reverse method. In a large scale application, itâ€™s usually always a good practice to avoid mutating arrays.

```jsx
const calcDisplaySummary = function (movements) {
	const incomes = movements
		.filter((mov) => mov > 0)
		.reduce((acc, mov) => acc + mov, 0);
	labelSumIn.textContent = `${incomes}`;
	const out = movements
		.filter((mov) => mov < 0)
		.reduce((acc, mov) => acc + mov, 0);
	labelSumOut.textContent = `${out}`;
};

calcDisplaySummary(account1.movements);

const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];
const euroToUsd = 1.1;

// PIPELINE
const totalDepositsUSD = movements
	.filter((mov) => mov > 0)
	// .map(mov => mov * euroToUsd)
	.map((mov, i, arr) => {
		// console.log(arr);
		mov * euroToUsd;
	})
	.reduce((acc, mov) => acc + mov, 0);
console.log(totalDepositsUSD);
```
