# A Closer Look at Functions

## Functions Accepting Callback Functions

: Why callback functions so much used in JavaScript? Well, the first big advantage of this is that it makes it easy to split up or code into more reusable and interconnected parts. But there is a second and way more important advantage, which is the fact that callback functions allow us to create abstraction.

Abstaction is something really important in programming. So basically what abstract means, is that we hide the detail of some code implementation because we don’t really care about all that detail. And this allows us to think about problems at a higher more abstract level.

```jsx
const oneWord = function (str) {
	return str.replace(/ /g, "").toLowerCase();
};

const upperFirstWord = function (str) {
	const [first, ...others] = str.split(" ");
	return [first.toUpperCase(), ...others].join(" ");
};

const transformer = function (str, fn) {
	console.log(`Original string: ${str}`);
	console.log(`Transformed string: ${fn(str)}`);

	console.log(`Transformed by: ${fn.name}`);
};

transformer("JavaScript is the best!", upperFirstWord);
```

## Functions Returning Functions

```jsx
const greet = function (greeting) {
	return function (name) {
		console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
	};
};

const greeterHey = greet("Hey");
greeterHey("Jonas");
greeterHey("Steven");

const greetArr = (greeting) => (name) => console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);

greetArr("Hi")("Jonas");
```

## The call and apply Methods

: How do we tell JavaScript explicitly or manually what this this keyword should look like? Well, there are three function methods to do that and they are call, apply and bind. And in the call method, the first argument is exactly what we want the this keyoword to point to. Then all the arguments after the first one are simply the arguments of the original function.

And the apply method does basically exactly the same thing. The only diffrence is that apply does not receive a list of arguments after the this keyword, but instead, it’s gonna take an array of the arguments.

```jsx
const lufthanse = {
	airline: "Lufthansa",
	iataCode: "LH",
	booking: [],
	book(flightNum, name) {
		console.log(
			`${name} booked a seat on ${this.airline} flight ${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`
		);
		this.booking.push({ flight: `${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`, name });
	},
};

lufthanse.book(239, "Jonas Schmetdmann");
lufthanse.book(523, "John Smith");
console.log(lufthanse);

const eurowings = {
	name: "Eurowings",
	iataCode: "EW",
	booking: [],
};

const book = lufthanse.book;

//  does not work
// book(23, 'Sarah Williams');

//  call method
book.call(eurowings, 23, "Sarah Williams");
console.log(eurowings);

book.call(lufthansa, 512, "Mary Cooper");
console.log(lufthansa);

const swiss = {
	airline: "Swiss Air Line",
	iataCode: "LX",
	booking: [],
};

book.call(swiss, 864, "Mary Cooper");
console.log(swiss);

// apply method
const flightData = [864, "Gorge Cooper"];
book.apply(swiss, flightData);
console.log(swiss);

// same as line 137
book.call(swiss, ...flightData);
```
