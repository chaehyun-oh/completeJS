# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Truthy and Falsy values

-   Falsy values : Values that are not exactly false, but will become false when we try to convert them into a boolean. In JavaScript, there are only 5 falsy values. `0 , '', undefined, null, Nan`
-   Truty values : Everything else are our so-called truthy values. Values that will be converted to true.

When exactly does JavaScript do type coercion to booleans?

: First, when using logical operators, and second in a logical context.

## Equality operators == vs ===

-   `===` : Is called the strict equality operator. only be the result of this operator in case that both sides are exactly the same.
-   `==` : loose equality operator actually does type coercion.
-   `!==` : different operator.

## Boolean Logic

: AND, OR, NOT
