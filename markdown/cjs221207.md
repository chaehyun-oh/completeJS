# Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional

## Review: Writing Clean and Modern JavaScript

### Readable Code

-   Write code so that others can understand it
-   Write code so that you can understand it in 1year
-   Avoid too “clever” and overcomplicated solutions
-   Use descriptive variable names: what they contain
-   Use descriptve function names: what they do

### General

-   Use DRY principle (refactor your code)
-   Don’t pollute global namespace, encapsulate instead
-   Don’t use `var`
-   User strong type checks (=== and !==)

### Functions

-   Generally, functions should do only one thing.
-   Don’t use more than 3 function parameters
-   Generally, return same data type as received
-   Use arrow functions when they make code more readable

### OOP

-   Use ES6 classes
-   Encapsulate data and don’t mutate it from outside the class
-   Implement method chaining
-   Do not use arrow functions as methods (in regular objects)

### Avoid nested code

-   Use early `return` (guard clauses)
-   Use ternary (conditional) or logical operators instead of `if`
-   Use multiple `if` instead of `if/else-if`
-   Avoid `for` loop, use array methods instead
-   Avoid callback-based asynchronous APIs

### Asynchronous code

-   Consume promises with async/await for best readability
-   Whenever possible, run promises in parallel (`Promise.all`)
-   Handle errors and promise rejections
