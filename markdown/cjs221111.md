## Working with localStorage

## Working with localStorage

: When we converted our objects to a string, and then back from the string to objects, we lost the prototype chain. And so new objects are now just regular objects. And so therefore, they will not be able to inherit any of their methods. So this can be a big problem when you work with object oriented programming.

Now to fix this problem, we could go ahead and restore the object. restore the objects by creating a new object using the class.

```jsx
_setLocalStorage() {
        localStorage.setItem('workouts', JSON.stringify(this.#workouts));
    }

    _getLocalStorage() {
        const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('workouts'));
        // console.log(data);

        if (!data) return;

        this.#workouts = data;

        this.#workouts.forEach(work => {
            this._renderWorkout(work);
        });
    }
    reset() {
        localStorage.removeItem('workouts');
        location.reload();
    }
```
