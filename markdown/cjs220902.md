# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Operator Precedence

: Javascript has a well-defined order of operator precedence. So basically the order in which operator are executed.

## Strings and Template literals

Template literals

: we can write a string in a more normal way, and then basically insert the variables directly into the string and then they will simply be replaced. So a template literal can assemble multiple pieces into one final string. Also template literals is to create multiline strings.

```jsx
const firstName = "Jonas";
const job = "teacher";
const birthyear = 1991;
const year = 2022;
const jonas =
	"I'm " + firstName + " a " + (year - birthyear) + " years old " + job + "!";
console.log(jonas);

const jonasNew = `I'm ${firstName}`;
console.log(jonasNew);
console.log("String with \n mulitple \n lines");
console.loe(`String
multiple
lines`);
```
