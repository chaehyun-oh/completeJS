# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## Constructor Functions and the new Operator

: We can use constructor functions, to build an object using a function. A constructor function is actually a completely normal function. The only difference between a regular function, and a function that we call constructor functions, is that we call a constructor function with the new operator.

-   new operator : is actually a very special operator because what it does is to call this functions here. So this function, but it does a whole lot more than just that.
    -   1. New { } is created
    -   2. function is called, this = { }
    -   3. { } linked to prototype
    -   4. function automatically return { }

> Constructor functions are not really a feature of the JavaScript language. Instead, they are simply a pattern that has been developed by other developers. And now everyone simply uses this.

```jsx
const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
	// console.log(this);

	// Instance properties
	this.firstName = firstName;
	this.birthYear = birthYear;

	// Never do this
	// this.calcAge = function () {
	//     console.log(2022 - this.birthYear);
	// };
};

const jonas = new Person("Jonas", 1991);

console.log(jonas);

//  1. New {} is created
//  2. function is called, this = {}
//  3. {} linked to prototype
//  4. function automatically return {}

const matilda = new Person("Matilda", 2019);
const jack = new Person("Jack", 1975);
console.log(matilda, jack);

const jay = "Jay";

console.log(jonas instanceof Person);
console.log(jay instanceof Person);
```

## Prototypes

First, each and every function in JavaScript automatically has a property callled prototype. And that includes, of couse, constructor functions. Now every object thatâ€™t created by a certain constructor fucntion will get access to all the methods and properties that we define on the constructors prototype property.

How and why does this actually works? It works because any object always has access to the methods and properties from its prototype.

```jsx
// Prototypes
console.log(Person.prototype);

Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
	console.log(2022 - this.birthYear);
};

jonas.calcAge();

console.log(jonas.__proto__);
console.log(jonas.__proto__ === Person.prototype);

console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas));
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(matilda));
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person));

Person.prototype.species = "Homo Sapiens";
console.log(jonas, matilda);
console.log(jonas.species, matilda.species);

console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty("firstName"));
console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty("species"));
```
