# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## Encapsulation: Protected Properties and Methods

: Encapsulation means to keep some properties and methods private inside the class so that they are not accessible from outside of the class.

Now, there are two big reasons why we need encapsulation and data privacy. First, it is to prevent code from outside of a class to accidentally manipulate or data inside the class. The second reason is that when we expose only a small interface so a small API consisting only of a few public methods then we can change all the other internal methods with more confidence.

## Encapsulation: Private Class Fields and Methods

: Private class fields and methods are actually part of a bigger proposal for improving and changing JavaScript classes which is simply called Class fields. Now this Classes fields proposal is currently at stage three. And so right now it’s now it’s actually not yet part of the JavaScript language. However, being at stage three means that it’s very likely that at some point, it will move forward to stage number four.

```jsx
// 1) Public fields
// 2) Private fields
// 3) Public methods
// 4) Private methods
// (there is also the static version)

class Account {
	// Public fields (instances)
	locale = navigator.language;

	// Private fields (instances)
	#movements = [];
	#pin;

	// 3) Public methods
	constructor(owner, currency, pin) {
		this.owner = owner;
		this.currency = currency;
		// protected property
		this.#pin = pin;
		// this._movements = [];
		// this.locale = navigator.language;

		console.log(`Thanks for opening an account, ${owner}!`);
	}
	// Public interface
	getMovements() {
		return this.#movements;
	}

	deposit(val) {
		this.#movements.push(val);
	}
	withdraw(val) {
		this.deposit(-val);
	}

	requestLoan(val) {
		if (this._approveLoan(val)) {
			this.deposit(val);
			console.log(`Loan approved`);
		}
	}
	// 4) Private methods
	_approveLoan(val) {
		return true;
	}
}

const acc1 = new Account("Jonas", "EUR", 1111);
console.log(acc1);

// acc1.movements.push(250);
// acc1.movements.push(-140);
acc1.deposit(250);
acc1.withdraw(140);
acc1.requestLoan(1000);
console.log(acc1.getMovements());

// console.log(acc1.#movements);
// console.log(acc1.#pin);
```
