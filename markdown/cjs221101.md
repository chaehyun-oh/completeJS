# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## Encapsulation: Protected Properties and Methods

: Encapsulation means to keep some properties and methods private inside the class so that they are not accessible from outside of the class.

Now, there are two big reasons why we need encapsulation and data privacy. First, it is to prevent code from outside of a class to accidentally manipulate or data inside the class. The second reason is that when we expose only a small interface so a small API consisting only of a few public methods then we can change all the other internal methods with more confidence.
