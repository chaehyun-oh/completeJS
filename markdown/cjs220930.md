# Working with Arrays

## The filter method

```jsx
const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];

const deposits = movements.filter(function (mov) {
	return mov > 0;
});
console.log(movements);
console.log(deposits);

const depositsFor = [];
for (const mov of movements) if (mov > 0) depositsFor.push(mov);
console.log(depositsFor);

const withdrawals = movements.filter((mov) => mov < 0);
console.log(withdrawals);
```

## The reduce method

: In the callback function of the reduce method, the first parameter is actually something called the accumulator.

Since the accumulator is the value that we will keep adding to what weâ€™re gonna do here is to add the current value to the accumulator. So the accumulator plus the current value. And this works because in each call of the callback function, the accumulator will be the current sum of all the previous values. And so we will really keep adding in each iteration of the loop.

And in fact, there is a ton of things that we can do with this reduce method. It is by far the most powerful array method there is. And because of that, it can also be the hardest one to use. So we always need to think exactly what we want the accumulator and the core value to be and how they should interact.

```jsx
const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];

// const blance = movements.reduce(function (acc, cur, i, arr) {
//   console.log(`Iteraion ${i}: ${acc}`);
//   return acc + cur
// }, 0);
const blance = movements.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
console.log(blance);

let blance2 = 0;
for (const mov of movements) blance2 += mov;
console.log(blance2);

// maxum value
const max = movements.reduce((acc, mov) => {
	if (acc > mov) return acc;
	else return mov;
}, movements[0]);
console.log(max);
```
