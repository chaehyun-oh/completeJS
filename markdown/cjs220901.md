# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Data types

Value : Object or Primitive

### The 7 Primitive Data Types

1. Number : Floation point numbers
2. String : Sequenve of characters
3. Boolean : Logical type that can only be true or false
4. Undefind : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (empty value)
5. Null : Also means ‘empty value’
6. Symbol (ES2015) : Value that is unique and cannot be changed
7. BigInt (ES2020) : Larger integers than the Number type can hold

> JavaScript has dynamic typing
> : We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable.
> Instead, data types are determined automatically.

JS comment : `//` , `/**/`

`typeof` : An operator can use to show the type of a value.

## Let, Const and Var

-   Let : to declare variables that can change later
-   Const : to declare variables that are not supposed to change at any point in the future
-   Var : basically the old way of defining variables, pretty much the same as let

## Basic Operators

An operator basically allows us to transform values or combine multiple values and really do all kind of work with values.

### Mathmatical or arithmetic operators

```jsx
// Math operator
const now = 2037;
const ageJonas = now - 1991;
const ageSarah = now - 2018;
console.log(ageJonas, ageSarah);

console.log(ageJonas * 2, ageJonas / 10, 2 ** 3);

const firstName = "Jonas";
const lastName = "Schmedtmann";
console.log(firstName + lastName);
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);

// Assignment operator
let x = 10 + 5;
x += 10;
x *= 4;
x++;
x--;
console.log(x);
```

### Comparison operator

: basically, we use comparison operators to produce Boolean values.

`>, <, >=, <=`

```jsx
console.log(ageJonas > ageSarah);
console.log(ageSarah >= 18);

const isFullAge = ageSarah >= 18;
```
