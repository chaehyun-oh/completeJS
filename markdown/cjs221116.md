# Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

## Promises and the Fetch API

### What are Promises?

-   Promise : An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asychronous operation.
-   Less formal ⇒ Promise : A container for an asynchronously delivered value.
-   even less formal ⇒ Promise : A container for a future value.

Advantage of using promises

-   We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results
-   Instead of nesting callbacks, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations: escaping callback hell

### The Promise Lifecycle

-   Pending : Before the future value is available. during this time, the asynchronous task is still doing its work in the background.
-   Settled : Then when the task finally finishes, we say that the promise is settled and there are two different types of settled promises and that’s fulfilled promises and rejected promises.

    -   Fulfilled : Success. The value is now available.
    -   Rejected : An error happened.

-   Build Promise : (e.g. Fetch API returns promise
-   Consume Promise : When we already have a promise (e.g. promise returned from Fetch API (easier and more useful part)

## Consuming Promises

```jsx
const getCountryData = function (country) {
	fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then((data) => renderCountry(data[0]));
};

getCountryData("portugal");
```

## Chaining Promises

```jsx
const getCountryData = function (country) {
	fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then((data) => {
			renderCountry(data[0]);
			const neighbor = data[0].borders?.[0];
			if (!neighbor) return;

			//  country 2
			return fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbor}`);
		})
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then((data) => renderCountry(data[0], "neighbour"));
};

getCountryData("spain");
```
