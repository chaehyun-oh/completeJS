# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Taking Decisions: if / else Statement

### if else control structure

`if` statement

: All we have to do is write `if` then open parenthesis and then a condition that is evalueated. And if this condition truns out to be true, then this block will be executed.

Whatever code that we write into this block, which is denoted by these curly braces will be executed whenever the condition is true.

`else` block is actually optional. So in the beginning we didâ€™t have this `else` block, Javascript will then simply move on to the next line after the `if` statement in case that the condition is false.

## Type Conversion and Coercion

: Types are one of the fundamental aspects in programming. and converting between types is something that we do in every programming language.

-   Type conversion : When we manually convert from one type to another.
-   Type coercion : When JavaScript automatically convert types behind the scenes for us. Type coercion happens whenever an operator is dealing with two values that have different type. So in that case, JavaScript will then, behind the scenes, convert one of the values to match the other value so that in the end, the operator can be executed.

NaN : JavaScript gives us this not a number vallue whenever an operation that involves numbers fails to produce a new number. NaN(not a number) actuallly means an invalid number.
