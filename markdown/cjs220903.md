# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Taking Decisions: if / else Statement

### if else control structure

`if` statement

: All we have to do is write `if` then open parenthesis and then a condition that is evalueated. And if this condition truns out to be true, then this block will be executed.

Whatever code that we write into this block, which is denoted by these curly braces will be executed whenever the condition is true.

`else` block is actually optional. So in the beginning we didâ€™t have this `else` block, Javascript will then simply move on to the next line after the `if` statement in case that the condition is false.
