# Advanced DOM and Events

## Lifecycle DOM Events

: When we say lifecycle, we mean right from the moment that the page is first accessed, until the user leaves it.

-   DOM contnet loaded : this event exfired by the document as soon as the HTML is completely parsed, which means that the HTML has been downloaded and been converted to the DOM tree. Also, all scripts must be downloaded and executed before the DOM content loaded event can happen.
-   load evnet the load event exfired by the window. As soon as not only the HTML is parsed. but also all the images and external resources like CSS files are also loaded. So basically when the complete page has finished loading is when this event get exfired.
-   before unload : which also get exfired on window. And so thatâ€™s before unload. And this event here is created immediately before a user is about to leave a page.

```jsx
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function (e) {
	console.log(e);
});

window.addEventListener("load", function (e) {
	console.log(`page fully loaded`, e);
});

window.addEventListener("beforeunload", function (e) {
	e.preventDefault();
	console.log(e);
	e.returnValue = "";
});
```
