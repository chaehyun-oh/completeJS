# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## Object.create

: Object.create works in a pretty different way than constructor functions and classes work. But with Object.create, there is still the idea of prototypal inheritance. However, there are no prototype properties involved. And also no constructor functions, and no new operator. So instead, we can user Object.create to essentially manually set the prototype of an object, to any ohter object that we want.

```jsx
const PersonProto = {
	calcAge() {
		console.log(2022 - this.birthYear);
	},

	init(firstName, birthYear) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
		this.birthYear = birthYear;
	},
};

const steven = Object.create(PersonProto);
console.log(steven);
steven.name = "Steven";
steven.birthYear = 2002;
steven.calcAge();

console.log(steven.__proto__ === PersonProto);

const sarah = Object.create(PersonProto);
sarah.init("Sarah", 1979);
sarah.calcAge();
```
