# Mapty App: OOP, Geolocation, External Libraries, and More!

## Final Considerations

-   Ability to edit, delete a workout
-   Ability to delete all workouts
-   Ability to sort workouts by a certain field
-   Re-build running and cycling objects coming from Local Storage

-   Ability to position the map a show all workouts
-   Ability to draw lines and shapes instead of just points
-   Geocode location from coordinates (”Run in Faro, Portugal”)
-   Display weather data for workout time and place (only after asynchronous JavaScript section)
