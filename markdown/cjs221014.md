# Advanced DOM and Events

## DOM Traversing

: DOM Traversing is basically walking through the DOM. Which means that we cans select an element based on another element. And this is very important because sometimes we need to select elements realtive to a certain other element. For example, a direct child of a direct paren element. Or sometimes we donâ€™t even know the structure of the DOM at runtime. And in all these cases, we need DOM Traversing.

-   querySelector() : finds children, no matter how deep in the DOM tree.
-   closet() : finds parents also no matter how far up in the DOM tree.

```jsx
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

//  Going downwards: child
console.log(h1.querySelectorAll(".highlight"));
//  that would work no matter how deep these child elements would be inside of the h1 element.
console.log(h1.childNodes);
console.log(h1.children);
h1.firstElementChild.style.color = "white";
h1.lastElementChild.style.color = "orangered";

//  Going upwartds :parents
console.log(h1.parentNode);
console.log(h1.parentElement);

h1.closest(".header").style.background = "var(--gradient-secondary)";
h1.closest("h1").style.background = "var(--gradient-primary)";

//  Going sideway: siblings
console.log(h1.previousElementSibling);
console.log(h1.nextElementSibling);

console.log(h1.previousSibling);
console.log(h1.nextSibling);

console.log(h1.parentElement.children);

[...h1.parentElement.children].forEach(function (el) {
	if (el !== h1) el.style.transform = "scale(0.5)";
});
```
