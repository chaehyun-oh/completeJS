# Mapty App: OOP, Geolocation, External Libraries, and More!

## How to plan a web project

### Project planning

1. User stories : Description of the application’s functionality from the user’s perspective. All user stories put together describe the entire application. So user stories are basically a high level overview of the whole application, which will allow us developers to determine the exact features that we need to implement in order to make the user stories actually work as intended.
2. Features
3. Flowchart : What we will build
4. Architecture : How we will build it
5. Development step

### User stories

-   User story : Description of the application’s functionality from the user’s perspective.
-   Common format : As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit] (who, what, why)

### Features

based on user stories.

### Flow chart

: Flow chart should of course contain these different features that we’re gonna contain how the different parts of the app interact with each other, which event makes sense to implement, and also how data flows across the application.
