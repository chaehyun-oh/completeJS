## What is javascript?

: Javascript is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

-   We don’t have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
-   Based on objects, for storing most kinds of data
-   We can use different styles of programming

## The Role of JavaScript in web development

-   HTML - content (noun)
-   CSS = presentation (adjectives)
-   JS = programming language: building web applications (verbs)

## There is nothing you can’t do with JS (well, almost…)

-   Dynamic effects and web applications in the browser (Front-end apps)
-   Web applications on web server (Back-end apps)
-   Native mobile applications
-   Native desktop applications
