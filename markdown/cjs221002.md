# Working with Arrays

```jsx
const calcAverageHumanAge = (ages) => {
	ages.map((age) => (age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4))
		.filter((age) => age >= 18)
		.reduce((acc, age, i, arr) => acc + age / arr.length, 0);
};

const avg1 = calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
const avg2 = calcAverageHumanAge([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);
console.log(avg1, avg2);
```

## The find method

: So as the name says, we can use the FInd method to retrieve one element of an array based on a condition.

The find method will actually not return a new array but it will only return the first element in the array that satisfies condition.

The find method is a bit similar to the filter method, but there are two differences. First, Filter method returns all the elements that match the condition while the find method only return first one.

And second and even more important, the filter method returns a new array while find method only returns the elemnt itself and not an array.

```jsx
const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];

const firstWithdrawal = movements.find((mov) => mov < 0);
console.log(firstWithdrawal);

const account = accounts.find((acc) => acc.owner === "Jessica Davis");
console.log(account);
```
