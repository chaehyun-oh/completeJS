# How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes

## An High-Level Overview of JavaScript

: JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled , dynamic, sigle-threaded, garbage-collected programming launguage with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

-   High-level : High-level languages such as JavaScript and Python, where we do not have to manage resources at all because these languages have so-called abstractions that take all of that work away from us.
-   Multi-paradigm :
    -   Paradigm : An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique.
    -   Procedural programming
    -   Object-oriented programming (OOP)
    -   Functional programming (FP)
        : JavaScript does all of it. So it’s really flexible and versatile.
-   First-class functions : In a language with first-class functions, functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.
-   Dynamic : Dynamically-typed language. In JavaScript, we don’t assign data types to variables. Instead, they only became known when the JavaScript engine executes our code. Also the type of variables can easily be changed as we reassign variables.
-   Non-blocking event loop :
    -   Concurrency model : how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.
    -   Why do we need that? ⇒ JavaScript runs in one single thread. so it can only do one thing at a time.
    -   So what about to a long-running tast? ⇒ Sounds like it would block the single thread. However, we want non-blocking behavior.
    -   How do we achieve that? ⇒ By using an event loop takes long running tasks, executes them in the “background”, and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.

## The JavaScript Engine and Runtime

What is a JavaScript Engine?

-   JS engine : Program that executes JavaScript code. (e.g. Google’s V-Eight)
    -   Call Stack : The call stack is where our code is actually executed using something called execution context.
    -   Heap : The heap is ans unstructured memory pool which stores all the objects that our application needs.

But the question is how the code is complied to machine code so that it actually can be executed afterwards.

Compilation vs. Interpretation

-   Compilation : Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer.
-   Interpretation : Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line.

Modern JavaScript engine now use a mix between compilation and interpretaion which is called just-in-time comilation.

-   Just-in-time (JIT) compilation : Enter code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately.
    > [Source code] ⇒ step.1 compilation ⇒ [Machine code] ⇒ step. 2 execution ⇒ [Program running]
