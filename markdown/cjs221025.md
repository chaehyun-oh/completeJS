# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## ES6 Classes

: ES6 classes, which essentially allow us to do the exact same thing(implement prototypal inheritance) but using a nicer and more modern syntax.

Classes in JavaScript do not work like traditional classes in other languages like JAVA or C++. So instead, classes in JavaScript are just syntactic sugar over what we learned last time. So thye still implement prototypal inheritance behind the scenes but with a syntax that makes more sense to people coming from other programming laguages. And so that was basically the goal of adding classes to JavaScript.

-   Classes are NOT hoisted.
-   Classes are first-class citizens.
-   Classes are excuted in stric mode.

```jsx
// class expression
// const PersonCl = class {};

// class declaration
class PersonCl {
	constructor(firstName, birthYear) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
		this.birthYear = birthYear;
	}
	// Methods will be added to .prototype property
	calcAge() {
		console.log(2022 - this.birthYear);
	}
	greet() {
		console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName}`);
	}
}

const jessica = new PersonCl("Jessica", 1996);
console.log(jessica);
jessica.calcAge();
console.log(jessica.__proto__ === PersonCl.prototype);

// PersonCl.prototype.greet = function () {
//     console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName}`);
// };
jessica.greet();
```
