# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript

## Prototypal Inheritance and The Prototype Chain

### How prototypal inheritance / delegation works

The new operator

-   An empty object is created
-   this keyword in constructor function call is set to the new object
-   The new object is linked (**proto** property) to the constructor function’s prototype property
-   The new object is returned from the constructor function call

If a property or a method cannot be found in a certain object, JavaScript will look into its prototype. ⇒ Prototypal inheritance / delegation
